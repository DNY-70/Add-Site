<P class="px-lg-5 px-sm-1 px-md-3 lead">A virtual showcase, tour or showroom is most effective when the right tools are 
  being utilized to achieve the intended goal. The right tool is critical in order to generate results whether you are 
  looking for more ways to interact with your audience, demonstrate your product or generate more leads. It is simply 
  not enough to only have a virtual showcase, it must contain the right tools and imagery that best represents the value
   you bring.
</P>

<p class="px-lg-5 px-sm-1 px-md-3">
  After spending over 2 years looking for the best platform such as; <a href="https://www.matterport.com/" class="link-dark">Matterport</a>, <a href="https://www.klapty.com/" class="link-dark">Klapty</a>, and <a href="https://www.cloudpano.com/" class="link-dark">CloudPano</a>, that can best
  serve the needs of my clients I came to the understanding that it is not about a superior platform with the best,
   flashiest interface graphics but rather what it can do and how well it can deliver results for a given situation.
    It turns out that there is no one size fits all when it comes to picking the right platform or provider, it is
     about taking a closer look at the desired outcome or goal and implementing the right tool accordingly.
</p>
     <p class="px-lg-5 px-sm-1 px-md-3 text-muted">
      side note: I am referring to platforms as sites in which a tour can be constructed and hosted, an external 
      program such as Pano2vr and 3DVista provide a more hands on approach to constructing and hosting tours
</P>
<p class="px-lg-5 px-sm-1 px-md-3">
  Below are the best tools out there that can be seamlessly utilized in a virtual showcase and start working for you 
  right away. This list is intended mainly for real estate professionals and business owners who are looking to learn 
  more about how they can better utilize virtual showcases within their business but applies to virtual service providers looking for ideas to expand their business.

          <p class="h5 pt-2 pb-5 text-muted">Scanning a space, room or property is generally where it begins and can be 
            done by anyone with a 360 camera or smartphone. The  scanning process affects the quality of the project the 
            most as it is the foundation of any virtual tour showcase.</p>

                <h3 class="my-3 py-3 pb-1">Using your smartphone</h3>
                <p class="lead">
                  Most smartphones are able to shoot a panorama right from the phone's camera application as a setting
                   you can enable. The end result is a long horizontal image down the middle. Most platforms can work 
                   around the problem by generating a blur or blacking out the top and the bottom of the pano while 
                   maintaining the image's symmetry. 
                  
                </p>
                <p class="pb-3">
                  Alternatively there are apps and gadgets out there that allow you to capture various different
                   angles of your space using your phone and use them to build a panorama, if done properly you can
                    achieve results comparable to that of a 360 camera.
                </p>
                <h3 class="pb-1">Using a 360 camera</h3>
                <p class="pb-3">
                  A 360 camera is often used by professionals to scan properties, there are commercial and consumer 
                  360 cameras but as the technology advances these cameras keep getting smaller and more affordable.
                   Popular brands for consumer brands for 360 cameras include Insta360 and Rico, they differ in the
                    way they operate but the process is simple; Scan, export, upload and build.

                <h3 class="pb-1">Getting a property scan or transferring a scan</h3>
                <p class="pb-3">
                  The last and fairly obvious option is to simply get a professional to come out and scan your property
                   for you, they often include editing, building and hosting within their services. When getting a
                    professional property scan it is a good idea to know what you are looking for so that you don't
                     end up with a product that doesn't deliver, looking at the digital tools they offer is a good
                      way to start and I will go over that in more detail below, but even after having purchased a
                       scan or a tour it is still very easy to transfer your media to another platform or provider
                        that best fits your needs.
                    
                    <!--pitch that we can do this work for them, specially the transgerring-->
                </p>
                <p>
                  Some vendors may not allow for the release of media and or may not
                  have it available depending on their file management process, you would need to bring this up
                   with your vendor to find out.
                </p>

                <p class="text-primary py-5">Since the value is retained within the 360 image itself we can help at 
                  almost any step of the process even if we are not serving your area. It may seem like a tedious
                   process and it can be, but we only need your current vendor's information to do this step for you! </p>

            <p class="h5 pt-3 text-muted">One of the main things that set a platform or virtual service provider apart

                  <h3 class="my-3 py-3">Device and platform compatibility</h3>
                  <p class="lead pb-5">
                    A virtual showcase, tour or showroom is hosted within a platform in the form of an application run when accessed via a web browser, that application is responsible for making your showcase or tour viewable and interactive to your audience depending on the device they are on. Most providers and platforms claim they are compatible with every single device, and most are indeed viewable, but they vary in quality and versatility of tools available across devices.

                    360 images and panos lie at the heart of a virtual tour and showcases, for this reason it is easy to work with other virtual tour vendors and in special cases real estate professionals themselves to integrate relevant tools and features that can best demonstrate the value being added or drive the most results.

          <p class="h5 text-muted">Virtual staging is the process of taking an empty space within a house or a building and digitally adding or removing furniture to showcase the potential of the property.

                <h3 class="my-3">2D staging vs 360 staging</h3>
                <p class="lead pb-5">
                  Virtual staging has been around for some time now in the form of a normal two dimensional image. As virtual tours begin to populate the real estate market, virtual staging is starting to extend into 360 compositions, this process adds another level of customization and complexity that hooks an audience every time which is why I cover it in more detail here. 
                </p>
                <h3 class="pt-3">Why stage?</h3>
                <p class="pb-5">
                  Staging has historically been an expensive process; bringing in furniture and physically designing a space takes high expertise on top of the hard labor involved with moving furniture in and out, there are ways to cut down on this by having props that are light and decorated beforehand but too much of that can hurt the design when it comes to adding or removing key details to make a space come to life. Digital staging is less problematic in this sense as a virtual designer has an almost endless array of models to work with, each of which is highly customizable in shape, size and color; this level of customization can be extended to the viewer by allowing them to swap sets of furniture and colors within the same tour.

                <h3 class="pt-3">
                  Who benefits from staging?
                </h3>
                <p class="pb-5">
                  As the name suggests this application seems to be more useful towards realtors selling homes or property managers renting out houses, but staging uses the same technology and processes that a 3D digital render does. An unwanted object, piece of furniture or entire structure can be digitally removed or added extending to the landscape too, things like sky and floor replacement, architectural changes and additions and even entire buildings can all be manipulated.

             </h2>
             <p class="text-muted pb-3">
              Although more rare I believe this practice will become more common as the technology emerges, it is possible to transmit a live feed of a tour using a stationary, hand held or secured camera. It is not common now due to the hands on set up requirements but handheld live tours using smartphones capturing landmarks and special events is already very popular online.

                You can go a step further into limiting the people that get to see your tour by making it viewable by link only or setting a password that is required when accessing the tour.

        <h2 class="text-dark pb-3">Floor plans</h2>
        <p class="h5 text-muted pb-5">A complete virtual tour can be used to generate a floor plan; a render to scale of a given property that shows the relationship between spaces and rooms, usually from an outside perspective.

              <h3 class="my-3 pt-3">Why get a floor plan and is a 3D floor plan worth it?</h3>
              <p class="lead pb-5">
                A digital floor plan can serve many different purposes; it is often used to demonstrate the layout of a property including window and door placement and the measurement and positioning of walls and surfaces. A 3D render of a floor plan adds depth and allows you to view the property as whole and from any perspective or angle you want, this is also called “dollhouse view”.

        <p class="h5 text-muted pb-5">Another feature you can take advantage of is 360 degree video playback, most platforms that support video generally limit the size of the file as video can get quite big in file size specially when filmed in 360 degrees.

              <h3 class="my-3">When it is a good idea to use 360 video?</h3>
              <p class="lead pb-5">
                Generally 360 video footage is meant to be edited and cut to frame depending on what is meant to be seen, this is usually the problem with full width 360 video footage as we can only focus on one thing at a time but this can actually serve a great purpose in many applications such as; Teaching, demonstrations, art, etc..
              </p>
              <h4>Teaching, demonstrations, art, etc..</h4>
              <p>
                There are many applications in which 360 footage can come in handy when dealing with complex applications 
                such as teaching a skill that has many moving parts or that is better learned on the field, a demonstration or 
                exhibit that is better viewed from up close and even physical or digital performing arts.
              </p>

            <p class="lead py-5">
              In conclusion a virtual tour can only be as effective as its purpose, getting the flashiest graphics, the best picture quality or the external drone shot may make your showcase stand out but it may not produce the results desired so making sure that we use the best mediums to connect with our audience is the most important role of a virtual showcase.
